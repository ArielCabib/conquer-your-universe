- use only colors from the constants.
- use only fonts from the set of fonts already widely used. don't add more.
- use only font sizes that are already used, don't add new ones.
- if new styles are added, say so explicitly so it could be monitored by the code reviewer.
- dont run pnpm commands if you are running without network access. also, there are no tests in this project.
- if a file exceeds 200 lines, try to split it to 2 or more files that have less than 150 lines of code, maintaining logical structure of course.
